Repo contains two tools:

First is reBHresh, a program created to allow the user to have BhRestTokens and SOAP v1 and v2 session keys automatically refreshed via UI. This refreshes REST tokens every 9:50 minutes, and SOAP keys every 4:50 minutes, respectively.

The second allows the user to edit the comment or description section of every record in Bullhorn, except Distribution Lists.

Both tools reside under src/main/java/reBHresh
